# PHP_Social_Network

This is a Social Network application. It features: databases, authentication, login, messaging, posts, following, and more! This Social Network's front-end is
responsive.The webstack that I used are: HTML, CSS, JQuery, PHP, and SQL. You can log in, follow other members, post public or private messages, edit your profile
section, and search other members. The application uses several tables within a database to save information and make queries. This web app was built thanks to
several PHP modules. JQuery was used to style, and make the app mobile friendly. Also, jQuery enabled asynchronous programming to display error messages to make for a
better UX.
